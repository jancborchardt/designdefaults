and design & test


TOPIC
Design Defaults
Essential interaction design
stuff which I find I need to repeat over and over again


JAN
share image
ownCloud
Unhosted & remotestorage
Terms of Service; Didn’t Read
(bunch of other projects: Github projects screenshot, insert OpenUsability, Strut, Tent, StuttgartJS, Tel Aviv JS,
Usability in Free Software


WORKING
modal
nuclear explosion → work lost
show of hands: who did that happen to?


UNDO
instead of modal
alistapart aza raskin
Gmail undo send, ownCloud undo delete
just lie!



PASSWORD repeat (purpose: prevent error … with introducing more potential for error? coding horror show password, Apple, Windows)
EMAIL repeat (userglue article, mailcheck.js)
SIGN IN/UP (Tumblr)
USER MENU (5apps jan/account/log out, log out is not primary …, user menu gun.io)

CANCEL (button directly next to submit = WTF, or just text far away, or just no cancel! [sign up form, »people are used to it«])
CLOSE (button … just X in the top right)

SEARCH (instant, fuzzy, never »no results« but show next relevant)
SORT (A-Z …, rather by relevance or activity, or last used)
AGE (last edited, greying, Litewrite, relative with absolute on hover)
SIZE (mostly interesting either for sending or for downloading, ownCloud MB [crazy on hover], file manager folder size fail, greying here also)

LOAD MORE (button, what do you think I’ll do?, shit work, click it, engaging, Google image search, AUTOMATIC)
TEXTBOX (intermittent scrolling, automatically resize, autosize plugin)
INFIELD LABELS ?

RIGHT CLICK (hard to discover, Tablets, Youtify & ownCloud)
CONTEXTUAL CONTROLS (law of proximity, Strut, popover menus like iOS, etch)
LIGHTBOX (buttons jump, lightbox screenshot, absolute position)

FEEDBACK (instant .1s spinner 1s loading bar 10s gtfo)
BLANK SLATE (not empty state, 37signals)
404 (unhelpful Github page … what do you think am I going to do? search!, just autosearch)
EMPTY NEW (under construction, just don’t, especially if settings)
SETTINGS (users always ask for an option, »put it as a setting«, AUTOMATIC!)
HIDE ADVANCED (ownCloud install)

LANGUAGE (alienating, URL→link/address, reboot, MIME type, bug, my vs you → profile)
